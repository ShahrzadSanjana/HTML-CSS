<li><h3>Why is it a problem for Altitude Online to use different information systems in its branch locations?</h3></li>             
<blockquote> By running different information systems (IS) in the same organization, one branch might be getting different type of information than another branch. This is because different IS may input data differently, process those inputs differently, lead to different outputs, and thereby lead to different feedback. This lack of consistency may lead to confusion amongst staff in the different branches and decrease overall productivity of Altitude Online. This fall in productivity may erode any competitive advantage they had.</blockquote>
<br>

<li><h3>What information should Jon collect from the branch offices to plan the new centralized information system?</h3></li>
<blockquote>Jon should collect information like how the current system is inadequate in meeting the businesses needs and how the branches expect the new system will be able to meet the changing needs of the new business.</blockquote>
<br>

<li><h3>With Jon's education and experience, he could design and implement a new information system Altitude Online himself.  What would be the benefits and drawbacks of doing the job himself compared to contracting with an information systems contractor?</h3></li>

<tr>
<td>Being involved with the organization as CIO, Jon would have a better understanding of where the current system is lacking and what the needs of the business will demand of the new system. Therefore he is more likely to design and implement a better system than an outside organization that will have to be told what the problem is and what is required.  
Outsourcing allows a company to focus on what it does best and delegate other functions to companies with expertise in systems development.</td>

<td>Jon would not be focusing on his other tasks and would likely be spending a lot of time on development of a new system. Furthermore, he could have given the task to a specialized systems development firm that possibly would have done a better job than Jon.</td>

</table></blockquote>
<br>

<li><h3>While Jon is visiting the branch offices, how might he prepare them for the inevitable upheaval caused by the upcoming overhaul to the information system?</h3></li>

<blockquote>User satisfaction with a computer system and the information it generates often depend on the quality of the system and the value of the information it delivers to users. A quality information system is usually flexible and efficient and provides information that is accurate, reliable, current and complete. Jon must keep this in mind when the IS is being developed.
<br>
Jon, like modern CIO’s, has to be a strategic communicator with his staff and an efficient project manager. He must align IT and business; use information systems to advance the goals of the organization.
<br>
The staff’s perceived usefulness of the technology generally depends on its ease of its use, its quality and the degree to which the organization supports it. Jon will have to assure his staff that the new system will be consistent and unified across all branches, making it easier to use by reducing confusion amongst the staff. User satisfaction and productivity will both rise. </blockquote>
